	dotnet --list-runtimes

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
is it correct to add C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\dotnet\net8.0\runtime to PATH ?
Copilot
Adding C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\dotnet\net8.0\runtime to your system‚Äôs PATH is not recommended. The reason is that this specific path points to the .NET runtime folder, which contains runtime components rather than the SDK or CLI tools.

To correctly add the .NET SDK to your PATH, follow the steps I mentioned earlier:

Install the .NET SDK (if you haven‚Äôt already).
Add the path to the .NET SDK installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\dotnet) to your system‚Äôs PATH.
By doing this, you‚Äôll ensure that you have access to the .NET CLI and can develop apps with .NET. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance! üòäüöÄ
