Blissary Bliss Dictionary ... the 3 symbols for "of"
  ...I remember, there is an entire small chapter about the word "of" in Blissymbolics ... in the big book by C. K. Bliss 
.... I think about using Ai to transcribe the chapter from the page scans

example: "cup of< tea"

I believe, 'of<' would be better here, than 'of>' . (there are 3 translations of the word 'of') // "of"
