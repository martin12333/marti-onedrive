this_ book_ is_ about_ Java­Script, but_ I_ sometimes_ talk_ about The next_  lan­guage , the lan­guage that_ will_ replace_ Java­Script. I have_to_ believe_ that_ there will be a lan­guage after_ Java­Script, because_ if_ Java­Script is the last_ lan­guage, that would_ be really_ sad_. We must find_ a way_ to_ the next lan­guage, if only for_ our_ kid_s. They deserve a better legacy than Java­Script.
I believe that children are our future. And also robot_s.

The next paradigm will be globally distributed, secure, eventual programming. The Internet demands this. Nearly all of our current programming lan­guages, including Java­Script, are still firmly rooted in the old paradigm of local, insecure, sequential pro­gram­ming. I see Java­Script as a transitional lan­guage. Adop­tion of the best practices in Java­Script will be good preparation for understanding the next paradigm.
