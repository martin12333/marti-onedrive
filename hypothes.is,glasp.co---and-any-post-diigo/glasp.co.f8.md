rk and effort again. So, I am feeling worried to use this extension anymore.

The sidebar with notes appear over the websites. So, most of the cases a huge part of the text is hidden. That is why someone needs to close and reopen the sidebar for several times and this is really irritating. The sidebar should push the website and should not appear over the website.

First of all, we apologize that your highlights and notes have gone. We've been updating the highlight logic, but there are some cases where highlights and notes lost due to the network issue, loading issue, etc. Now, we're testing the updated version of the Chrome extension internally, which is more robust and solves the issue.

Second of all, you can change the size (width) of the sidebar. A bit hard to find, but if you hover a mouse at the left bottom of the sidebar, you can find an arrow icon to update the side. The screen size depends on the screen you're using, so please update it.









3) When Markdown is copied or downloaded, all of the HTML and code appear without any inline or next-line gaps. It would be highly beneficial if the original formatting could be preserved in the copied or downloaded content. This happens when I download my highlights in other formats too.
