  * stack - A cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects (similar to cabal)
  * hls   - (optional) A language server for developers to integrate with their editor/IDE

ghcup installs only into the following directory,
which can be removed anytime:
  /home/vscode/.ghcup

Press ENTER to proceed or ctrl-c to abort.
Note that this script can be re-run at any given time.


Do you want to install haskell-language-server (HLS)?
HLS is a language-server that provides IDE-like functionality
and can integrate with different editors, such as Vim, Emacs, VS Code, Atom, ...
Also see https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/



 Please ensure the following distro packages are installed before continuing (you can exit ghcup and return at any time):

 sudo apt install build-essential curl libffi-dev libffi8ubuntu1 libgmp-dev libgmp10 libncurses-dev libncurses5 libtinfo5





In order to run ghc and cabal, you need to adjust your PATH variable.
To do so, you may want to run 'source /home/vscode/.ghcup/env' in your current terminal
session as well as your shell configuration (e.g. ~/.bashrc).
