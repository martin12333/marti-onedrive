[a quote]
I usually check if the software gets installed in the root directory such as Python. Because if a folder is created in the root directory, it is writable for all authenticated users by default. And software like Python, Ruby, Perl etc. usually added to the PATH variable.

One last check left. We should ensure if the C:\Python27 directory is added in the PATH environment variable. The easiest way to do this, typing  ‘python -h’  in the shell. If the help page is displayed successfully it means the directory is added to the PATH.
