I will slowly start to comment and compare this to Blissymbolics.
I am glad, that the symbol-order is the English-like, and not the opposite, like in Bliss.


I am glad, that the symbol-order (inside words) here is English-like ... like "ADJECTIVE NOUN" ... and not the opposite, like in Bliss ... like NOUN(ADJECTIVE) .... I mean https://www.reddit.com/r/visual_conlangs/comments/i73ipj/btw_i_believe_bliss_has_an_unfortunate/




BTW, I believe Bliss has an unfortunate symbol-order ... just the opposite of the English word-order ... e.g. work-day in Bliss is [day][work]
... in Bliss, the symbol order inside words, e.g. [day][work], is ... like NOUN(ADJECTIVE) ... like NOUN (of) ADJECTIVE ... day of work ... basically, a day

I have seen people, who don't know about it, and then probably think, that Bliss is not logical.

I have seen people, who like Bliss, but don't know about the symbol-order, and then try to read compound symbols "backwards" ... "day work" ... basically, a kind of work ...

EDIT: more examples are in the comments at https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/i5pv90/idea_for_a_modal_ideographic_script_call_for/g103778/?context=3







Multiple-character Bliss-words usually begin with a classifier in first position.
work-day in Bliss is [day][work]  ... EDIT: like NOUN(ADJECTIVE)
birthday in Bliss is [day][birth]
a day-work in Bliss could be [work][day]

// EDIT: distantly related: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound

greenhouse in Bliss is [house][plant]
Home is [house][feeling]
School is [house][giving][knowledge]  ... EDIT: like NOUN(ADJECTIVE)

In Bliss and EmojiBliss:

* 💛 [feeling](https://www.xelify.se/blissdictionary/?q=feeling)

*  °💛 [heart](https://www.xelify.se/blissdictionary/?q=heart) ... thing-indicator(feeling)

* -💛->  [love](https://www.xelify.se/blissdictionary/?q=love) ... feeling(arrow)

In Bliss and EmojiBliss:

 ➜	➜   love ... feeling(arrow)

In the standard Bliss, and in emoji-Bliss (rough approximations):

EDIT: another interesting experiment is to search through Iconic.ahk for an emoji Unicode string, e.g. ❤️⭐

An alternative method for entering logographic characters is: by "abusing" the word-completion in some editors:

* it works in the Geany editor, even for PUA characters [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLJpMh6.png) (**PUA** = the Private Usea Area of Unicode)
* works in SublimeText, even for PUA characters [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wD0Srw5.png)
* should work in the ACE editor
* works in VSCode, even for PUA characters
* todo test the VSCode-online ... http://vscode.dev
* todo test ACE

&#x200B;

* text sample for testing:

&#8203;

    // completion-test.txt.coffee
    // some identifiers, that contain non-ascii characters
    // E5 ... PUA
    // 1f3 ... emojis

    abc4E_人_1 abcAC_가_2 abcE5__3 abc1f3_🌀_4

    // additional identifiers


EDIT 2023: a cleaner method is to define a snippet file for the editor
