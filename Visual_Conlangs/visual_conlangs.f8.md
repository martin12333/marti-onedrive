My dream project is to make conlangs, that are crossovers of Blissymbols and Emojis.

In Bliss and EmojiBliss:

* 💛 [feeling](https://www.xelify.se/blissdictionary/?q=feeling)

* -💛->  [love](https://www.xelify.se/blissdictionary/?q=love) ... feeling(arrow)




Oh, that is cool, and how may I help?

re: cool help

I would suggest moving this discussion into some **group**
I know about these possibilities:

1. reddit visual_conlangs, public, 100+ people
2. facebook visual conlangs, public, 100- people
3. facebook daily visual conlangs, public, a few people historically
4. facebook "post-bliss", Private, a few people historically
5. reddit daily visual conlangs, public, 2? people historically
6. facebook-messenger  "post-bliss", Private, a few people historically

(i would prefer a **public** group)

which possibilities would you prefer?



so, i a few days, i hope i will make a post to "2. facebook visual conlangs, public, 100- people" ... then i will copy a link to the post here




or rather:
i plan to post several items, firstly only to the group
"3. facebook daily visual conlangs, public, a few people historically".
I will paste links to the new posts here.

you know
My dream project is to make conlangs, that are crossovers of Blissymbols and Emojis.

During years,  I have made several attempts.

Firstly, I will  collect links to the posts, that are scattered at Facebook, reddit, and google-drive (google-sheets).

But this time, I will keep
the **symbol-order**
from the standard Blissymbolics
unchanged.



 ... as much as possible ...
, especially 





I will slowly start to comment and compare this to Blissymbolics.
I am glad, that the symbol-order is the English-like, and not the opposite, like in Bliss.


I am glad, that the symbol-order (inside words) here is English-like ... like "ADJECTIVE NOUN" ... and not the opposite, like in Bliss ... like NOUN(ADJECTIVE) .... I mean https://www.reddit.com/r/visual_conlangs/comments/i73ipj/btw_i_believe_bliss_has_an_unfortunate/


EDIT 2024: not unfortunate ... Toki Pona, and Unicode Emoji ZWJ sequences, have the same symbol-order as Bliss

BTW, I believe Bliss has an unfortunate symbol-order ... just the opposite of the English word-order ... e.g. work-day in Bliss is [day][work]
... in Bliss, the symbol order inside words, e.g. [day][work], is ... like NOUN(ADJECTIVE) ... like NOUN (of) ADJECTIVE ... day of work ... basically, a day

I have seen people, who don't know about it, and then probably think, that Bliss is not logical.

I have seen people, who like Bliss, but don't know about the symbol-order, and then try to read compound symbols "backwards" ... "day work" ... basically, a kind of work ...

EDIT: more examples are in the comments at https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/i5pv90/idea_for_a_modal_ideographic_script_call_for/g103778/?context=3







Multiple-character Bliss-words usually begin with a classifier in first position.
work-day in Bliss is [day][work]  ... EDIT: like NOUN(ADJECTIVE)
birthday in Bliss is [day][birth]
a day-work in Bliss could be [work][day]

// EDIT: distantly related: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound




---
greenhouse in Bliss is [house][plant]
Home is [house][feeling]
School is [house][giving][knowledge]  ... EDIT: like NOUN(ADJECTIVE)

EDIT: similar: Toki Pona

EDIT: similar: Latin: Homo sapiens

([Logographic Fonts | Table of Contents](https://www.reddit.com/r/visual_conlangs/comments/cf6rdv/logographic_fonts_table_of_contents/))

An alternative method for entering logographic characters is: by "abusing" the word-completion in some editors:

* it works in the Geany editor, even for PUA characters [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLJpMh6.png) (**PUA** = the Private Usea Area of Unicode)
* works in SublimeText, even for PUA characters [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wD0Srw5.png)
* should work in the ACE editor
* works in VSCode, even for PUA characters
* todo test the VSCode-online ... http://vscode.dev
* todo test ACE

&#x200B;

* text sample for testing:

&#8203;

    // completion-test.txt.coffee
    // some identifiers, that contain non-ascii characters
    // E5 ... PUA
    // 1f3 ... emojis
