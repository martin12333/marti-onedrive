To me ... THE main feature of VSCode,...




For years I have enjoyed using this feature multiple times a day
(workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText) and I always have a keyboard shortcut configured to run it for all sorts of commands (cmd, wsl, az cli, ...)





a public collection of text files, that contain a mix of one-line commands and notes (*.f8.sh, *.f8.py, etc., ... not only *.f8.ps1 for PowerShell)
