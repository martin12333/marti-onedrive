I need to make a simple change in a C++ program. In the program, every line of the form

cin >> x;

should be replaced with

x = cinfunction();

You can assume, that x is always a `char`.

The original program is:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    char yn;
    char y = 'y';
    char n = 'n';
    cout << "(You and your friend are walking on the street) Hej! I'm hungry, do you want some icecream? (y/n)" << endl;
    cin >> yn;
}

```
