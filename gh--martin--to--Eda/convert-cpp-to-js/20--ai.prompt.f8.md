I need to make a simple change in a C++ program. (The more distant goal is to convert the program from C++ to browser Javascript.)

In the program, every pair of  lines of the form

```cpp
cout << s << endl;
cin >> x;
```

should be replaced with

```cpp
x = outin(s);
```

You can assume, that `s` is always a string, and that `x` is always a `char`.

The original program is:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    char yn;
    char y = 'y';
    char n = 'n';
    cout << "(You and your friend are walking on the street) Hej! I'm hungry, do you want some icecream? (y/n)" << endl;
    cin >> yn;
}

```
