# write a stand up comedy script about the risks, that businesses might face, when adopting IoT devices

Show drafts






These devices come with more holes than Swiss cheese.




Thanks everyone, good night!  And hey, if you see a pair of shoes sprinting down the street, do a good deed and chase after them – maybe they're lost!





# write a stand up comedy script about bits and bytes





First off, bytes are like the atoms of the computer world. They’re the building blocks of everything. You’ve got your 8-bit bytes ...


Comedian: Now, imagine a byte at a party. It’s hanging out with its friends—the nibble, the word, and the double word. They’re all sipping on binary martinis, discussing the meaning of life. The byte leans over and says, “Hey, nibble, what’s the secret to happiness?” And the nibble replies, “01001000 01100001 01110110 01100101 00100000 01101110 01101111 00100000 01110010 01100101 01100111 01110010 01100101 01110100 01110011.” Translation: “Have no regrets.”

#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
void print_bytes(const T& input, std::ostream& os = std::cout)
{
  const unsigned char* p = reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(&input);
  os << std::hex << std::showbase;
  os << "[";
  for (unsigned int i=0; i<sizeof(T); ++i)
    os << static_cast<int>(*(p++)) << " ";
  os << "]" << std::endl;;
}

int main()
{
  int i = 12345678;
  print_bytes(i);
  float x = 3.14f;
  print_bytes(x);
}

# write a stand up comedy script about  troubles of a programmer

they’re like rival gangs. You write beautiful code, and they’re all, “Nah, we don’t play nice here.” It’s like trying to organize a peace summit between cats and dogs.






Comedian (Programmer): Let’s not forget about imposter syndrome. Every programmer secretly believes they’re a fraud. We’re like undercover agents infiltrating the Matrix, hoping nobody realizes we’re just Googling our way through life.





# Tell me more JavaScript jokes!

Why did the JavaScript developer cross the road? To async-await for the chicken to finish crossing!

Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn’t C# without them!

And the other computer replies, “Nah, I’m more of a 0xC0FFEE kind of gal.”





# write a stand up comedy script about pointers in C++


But let’s be honest, sometimes they lead you down a dark alley, and suddenly you’re face-to-face with a null pointer. Scary stuff, right?

Audience: (nervous laughter)

Comedian: Now, let’s talk about the ampersand, that sneaky little character. It’s like the James Bond of C++. You put it in front of a variable, and suddenly, it’s not just a variable anymore—it’s a secret agent. It’s got a license to reference! And when you see an ampersand, you know things are about to get serious.

Audience: (leaning in)

Comedian: So, imagine you’re at a party, and you spot a cute variable across the room. You want to get its address, right? Well, that’s when you whip out your best pickup line: “Hey, baby, can I get your memory location?” Smooth, right? And if it’s a pointer, you’re basically saying, “I want to follow you around everywhere, even into the void!”

Audience: (chuckles)

Comedian: But let’s not forget about dereferencing. It’s like opening a present—you’ve got this pointer, and you’re dying to know what’s inside. So, you use the asterisk, and voilà! You unwrap that memory location, and there it is: an integer, a double, or maybe even a char

Comedian: But beware the dangling pointer! It’s like a ghost haunting your code. You think you’ve got a valid address, but nope—it’s just a phantom. You dereference, and suddenly your program crashes. It’s like stepping on a landmine, except the explosion is a segmentation fault. And trust me, that’s not a party you want to attend.



# write a song about bits and bytes in programming languages




Eight bits together, a byte they compose,
Holding a character, the information it flows.
Integers march, in their numeric might,
Floats dance and sway, with decimals so light.





So next time you write code, remember this tune,
Bits and bytes dancing under the moon.
In the binary ballroom, they find their place,
Creating software magic with elegance and grace.
