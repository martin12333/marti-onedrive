That's a great recommendation! Creating a **Windows Restore Point** before and after an installation can help protect your system. If the installation causes any issues, you can use the restore point to return your system to the state it was in before the installation. This can be a lifesaver when dealing with problematic software or updates. Here's a brief guide on how to do it:

1. **Before Installation:**
    - Open the **Start Menu** and type 'Create a restore point' and click on it.
    - Select the **System Protection** tab and then click on the **Create** button.
    - Enter a description for the restore point (for example, 'Before Software Installation') and then click **Create**.

2. **After Installation:**
    - Repeat the steps above, but give the new restore point a different name (for example, 'After Software Installation').

Remember, it's always a good idea to create restore points regularly and especially before making any major changes to your system. It's a simple step that can save a lot of time and frustration later on. üëç
