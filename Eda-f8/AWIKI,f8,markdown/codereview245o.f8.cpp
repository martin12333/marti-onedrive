I am just a hobbyist. Is there a way to set a hard limit on spending at Microsoft Azure?

		Unfortunately, Azure doesn't offer a hard spending limit in the way you might expect for most accounts. This means you can't set a specific amount and have Azure automatically shut down spending once you reach it.

		Budgets: Azure Cost Management lets you set budgets for your account. This isn't a hard limit, but it will send you alerts when you reach a certain percentage of your budget. You can then take manual steps to control spending, like disabling unused resources.  '   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit

Is this true? ...		Unfortunately, Azure doesn't offer a hard spending limit. This means you can't set a specific amount and have Azure automatically shut down spending once you reach it.


You’re absolutely right! I appreciate your attention to detail. Unfortunately, Azure doesn’t provide a hard spending limit that automatically shuts down spending once a specific amount is reached. Instead, users have to rely on other methods to manage their costs effectively.
...
Remember that the spending limit isn’t available for subscriptions with commitment plans or pay-as-you-go pricing.

Get Started with Azure in Open Licensing

Azure service credits are redeemable in increments of the approximate equivalent of $100 per unit purchased. See the equivalent amount of Azure service credit per unit purchased by currency using the currency selector. The below table is the list of currencies that can be used to purchase Azure.

You can add credits to your Azure in Open subscription(s) at any time by purchasing through your partner using the same process you followed originally. Credits are used on a ‘first in first out’ basis and each purchase must be used within 12 months of activation.



In the event you are at risk of exhausting your credits prior to reordering additional credits through your partner, there is an option to add credits to your subscription(s) through the use of a credit card. This is done by selecting the subscription to which you would like add credits in the usage and billing portal. From this page, select the ‘Add Credits’ option and then select the credit card option under ‘Method.’



No. The Azure in Open program does not offer any rollover benefits to future periods. Customers have a “use or lose” deadline that expires 12 months after the date of activation. If a customer has activated multiple OSA keys at different times, each key will have a separate expiration date based on the each key’s individual activation date.




If an Azure in Open subscription reaches a zero balance the services will be suspended. The data will be retained for 90 days and once funds are added to the subscription the services can be reinstated, however there could be some services that would need to be redeployed.
