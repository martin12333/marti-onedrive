    y:
        Okay! (You go up to the icecream van down the street but your friend doesn't have anymore money left)\n    Hej! I don't have any money left! Can you give me some money? (y/n):
            y:
                (You give some money to your friend) Thanks! (And you two eat your icecream) [end]:
            n:
                (You say you don't have money) Oh well, that's okay i guess... [end]:
            else:
