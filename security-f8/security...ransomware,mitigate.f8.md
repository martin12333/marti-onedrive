An important thing to consider here, that I think a lot of replies are missing, is that since this is a crime, it is not on the back of IT to manage this process. You should certainly be closely involved, but given that this is a crime committed against the company, someone at the executive level needs to be running it. Thinking that you as an admin needs to be making a decision about whether to restore company functionality or cooperate with federal authorities is insane. That is someone else's decision to make.







Once a system has been identified as potentially having ransomware, the potentially infected computer should be immediately removed from your networks (including WiFi), and either shut down or ideally hibernated (to assist in forensic and sample analysis) to minimize the risk of the ransomware continuing the encryption process.




Report the Incident: Notify your organizationâ€™s IT/security team. They can guide you through the next steps and coordinate the response.








So, experts are urging the victims to either hibernate their infected PCs or power them down 


 Symantec Survey says that experts are recommending against PC reboots as it does worse than good.

Imagine a ransomware attack on a personal computer in an organization, where their IT staff won't help for hours. Would it be advisable to consider disconnecting from the network of *many* of the personal computers?

 and hibernating 

, not only those that already show a ransom message?
