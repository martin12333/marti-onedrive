Spam filter strength in this sub was too high

in recent months, reddit is targetted by tons of crypto spam

https://www.reddit.com/r/visual_conlangs/about/edit?page=posts

now it seems,  i set  the
"Spam filter strength"
way way too high ('ALL')


'HIGH' is the standard filter, 'LOW' disables most filtering, 'ALL' will filter every post initially and they will need to be approved manually to be visible


reddit didnt notify me well enough , that there are posts waiting

so i am going back to 'HIGH'

and i will be promoting some posters to be moderators, so they could approve their posts, if i mis-set again



today, i searched for new bliss posts at reddit, and found you, and found that your 4 posts are marked "Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters." I have no idea, why. I accepted the posts immediately. next time, please message the moderators. i am still relatively new to moderating, and i do not understand , why reddit didnt notify me about these 4 posts.

EDIT: and I have added you as a moderator, so you can approve your posts










můžete mi občas něco z těch programů poslat ... slibuju, že nebudu kritizovat
