if I do more than one highlight per page, only 1 highlight is remembered by diigo.com.

anyone else experiencing this now?

(I have also written about this to the https://www.diigo.com/common/contact )

EDIT: interestingly, for pages *.diigo.com , it works OK

EDIT: trying to remove and reinstall the extension .... didn't help

EDIT could also try the bookmarklet .... didn't help
