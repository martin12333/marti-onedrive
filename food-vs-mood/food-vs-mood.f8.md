Body Mass Index (BMI): A BMI below 15 kg/m² is often a critical indicator for considering inpatient treatment rather than partial hospitalization or outpatient care1. Additionally, a BMI below 13.5 can lead to organ failure, while a BMI below 12 can be life-threatening2.

BMI < 13 is an indicatior for certification under the Mental Health Act if the patient refuses admission although BMI < 13 alone is not enough for admission.

# Involuntary Treatment of Patients With Life-Threatening Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. Predictors of mortality include chronicity of the illness, critically low body weight, and binging and purging behavior. Delusional beliefs body image, coupled with impaired judgment and cognition caused by starvation, often result in these patients adamantly resisting efforts to treat them. Guardianship, although useful in assisting with medical treatment decisions for patients with anorexia nervosa who are critically medically ill, is usually an inadequate intervention with respect to psychiatric treatment for these patients. Despite the severity and risk of the illness, there is often reluctance among providers to initiate involuntary treatment for patients with anorexia nervosa. Recent legal cases involving patients with anorexia nervosa have addressed the role of the committing court in authorizing treatment decisions and, in one case, opining that a patient was best served by receiving treatment in another state. Other related concerns addressed by the courts include ensuring that appropriate criteria are used for hospital admission, clarifying that the definition of grave disability as it pertains to anorexia does not require that the patient be close to death and that medications are often warranted in treating patients with the disease.
