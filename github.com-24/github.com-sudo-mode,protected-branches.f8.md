Here is the markdown that would fit at $PLACEHOLDER$:

# GitHub.com Sudo Mode and Protected Branches

To enable sudo mode on GitHub.com, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
2. Select the "Security" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Sudo Mode" section.
4. Toggle the switch to enable sudo mode.

Once sudo mode is enabled, you will be prompted to enter your password whenever you perform an action that requires elevated privileges.

Regarding protected branches, you can set up branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes. Here's how:

1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.com.
2. Select the "Branches" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Branch protection rules" section.
4. Click on "Add rule" to create a new branch protection rule.
5. Specify the branch name and the desired protection settings, such as requiring pull request reviews or status checks.
6. Save the rule to apply the branch protection.

By enabling sudo mode and setting up branch protection rules, you can enhance the security and control of your GitHub.com repositories.
