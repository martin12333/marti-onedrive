# and Protected Branches


https://github.com/Tech-La-Bo-Radotin/EL-programming-repo/settings/branch_protection_rules/new

> Branch protection rule
Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.



**Your rules won't be enforced on this private repository until you upgrade this organization to GitHub Team or Enterprise.**

About protected branches
You can protect important branches by setting branch protection rules, which define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.

Who can use this feature?

**Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations.**


 Protected branches are also available in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server.For more information, see "GitHub’s plans."

Protect matching branches
Require a pull request before merging

2. Select the "Branches" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Branch protection rules" section.
4. Click on "Add rule" to create a new branch protection rule.
5. Specify the branch name and the desired protection settings, such as requiring pull request reviews or status checks.

Branch protection rule
Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.

Your rules won't be enforced on this private repository until you upgrade this organization to GitHub Team or Enterprise.

Branch name pattern
Protect matching branches
Require a pull request before merging
....


When enabled, all commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged into a branch that matches this rule.
Require status checks to pass before merging
Choose which status checks must pass before branches can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another branch, then merged or pushed directly to a branch that matches this rule after status checks have passed.
Require conversation resolution before merging
When enabled, all conversations on code must be resolved before a pull request can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. Learn more about requiring conversation completion before merging.



Require signed commits
Commits pushed to matching branches must have verified signatures.
Require linear history
Prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching branches.
Require deployments to succeed before merging
Choose which environments must be successfully deployed to before branches can be merged into a branch that matches this rule.
Lock branch
Branch is read-only. Users cannot push to the branch.
Do not allow bypassing the above settings
The above settings will apply to administrators and custom roles with the "bypass branch protections" permission.
Restrict who can push to matching branches
Specify people, teams, or apps allowed to push to matching branches. Required status checks will still prevent these people, teams, and apps from merging if the checks fail.
Rules applied to everyone including administrators
Allow force pushes
Permit force pushes for all users with push access.

Allow deletions
Allow users with push access to delete matching branches.
