powershell for each directory in directory c:\temp do something:

Given a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of updates.

If an update is a relationship, provide [ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2]. The relationship is directed, so the order matters.

Example:

prompt:
Alice is Bob's roommate.

updates:
["Bob", "roommate", "Alice"]

prompt:
Alice is Bob's roommate.

updates:



When I was in college almost a decade ago, I lived on the computer science floor of my dorm. It was quite possibly one of the most interesting places Iâ€™ve ever lived.

 It was full of nerds, and we had file shares and LAN parties every weekend. While I was there, I got introduced to a tool called Hamachi that we used in order to keep playing games like Minecraft, StarCraft (Brood War), and Age of Mythology together over winter and summer breaks.

 We shared our photos, code creations, and more; all over that shared network. This allowed us to be together even on breaks, when we were on opposite sides of the state.

Tailscale tries to be zero-configuration: you install it, log in, and it should just work. That means we need to interact with the underlying OS a bunch.

Well, originally it was just "The ARPAnet". In 1977 friends introduced me to it. We used a TI Silent 700 terminal. This was a printing terminal which used thermal paper and built-in 300 baud acoustic coupled modem. One would dial a local "TIP". For instance there was one at Mitre, a nearby company. One would then type @L 134 to connect to host 134, or whatever. There was no TIP (later TAC) login at that time. Host numbers were always a single number of up to three digits. No dots. Host names were always short and uppercase, and also had no dots.

Eev's approach is the opposite of that. I wrote the first functions of eev in my first weeks after installing GNU/Linux in my home machine and starting using GNU Emacs, in 1994; before that I was using mostly Forth (on MS-DOS), and I hadn't had a lot of exposure to *nix systems by then --- in particular, I had tried to understand *nix's notions of user IDs and file ownerships and permissions, and I felt that they were a thick layer of complexity that I wasn't being able to get through.
