fortran code to compute a dual basis


Here is an example Fortran code that computes the dual basis of a given basis:

```fortran
program dual_basis
  implicit none

  integer, parameter :: n = 3
  real :: A(n,n), B(n,n), C(n,n)
  integer :: i, j

  ! Define the basis A
  A = reshape([1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.], [n,n])

  ! Compute the inverse of A
  B = inv(A)

  ! Compute the dual basis C
  do i = 1, n
    do j = 1, n
      C(i,j) = B(j,i)
    end do
  end do

  ! Print the dual basis C
  write(*,*) "Dual Basis:"
  write(*,'(3f8.2)') C

end program dual_basis
```

This code defines a basis `A`, computes its inverse `B`, and then computes the dual basis `C` using the formula $C_{ij} = B_{ji}$.

You can modify this code to use your own basis by changing the values in the array `A`.

I hope this helps!

What is a dual basis?

Can you explain how this code works?
