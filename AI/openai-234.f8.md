// a note for Martin only ... at the end  ... setting up an openai  org?



Hi everyone!
(I used to be an ML student.) (Antidepressants did to me more harm than good.) Now I am trying to understand better today's neural networks, especially the GPTs. I am editing jupyter notebooks ... doing little experimets. 
And I am very interested in analogies between GPTs and human brain.


bash
grep -oE --no-filename -R 'cmap[=]........{,3}' | sort|uniq -c  | sort -n

```python
      4 cmap=\"Blues\")
      4 cmap=\"cet_\" +
      4 cmap=plt.cm.Spe
      4 cmap='RdBu_r')
      4 cmap='YlOrBr' )
      5 cmap='Blues')"
      8 cmap='Blues')\n
     12 cmap='RdBu', vm
     14 cmap='gray', in
```
', 'RdYlBu', 'RdYlBu_r', 'RdYlGn', 'RdYlGn_r',
BrBG', 'BrBG_r
RdBu', 'RdBu_r'


pretrained
embeddings instead of 

EDIT: I FORGOT TO ASK: PRETRAINED? do you want to use pretrained embeddings? (I didn't research the training of one's own embeddings, I apologize)

heart
Oh, I am researching this topic for many days now.
(Are you at reddit? fast.ai?  kaggle? lesswrong?  github? )
What level do you want?

I do like this notebook  https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/01_Exploring_Word_Embeddings.ipynb
> 2019 update: This turned out to be a misconception. The result is actually closer to "king" than it is to "queen", it's just that the code rules out the input vectors as possible outputs

hrozi misunderstanding ... ja jsem needitoval ten 2019
( i have edited my copy of the notebook beyond recognition  now  ;-)   )



I now have a dream project: something like ... linear algebra, for neural networks, in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

> People often use “neuron” to refer to many different parts of a transformer. I specifically mean the hidden state of the MLP layers, after the activation function. I do not mean the residual stream, layer outputs, keys, queries or values, attention pattern, etc.   #aaaa!a
