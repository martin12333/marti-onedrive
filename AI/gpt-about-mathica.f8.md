Here is the Mathematica code to compute the dual basis:

```mathematica
(* Define the basis *)
basis = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};

(* Compute the dual basis *)
dualBasis = Simplify[Inverse[basis]]

(* Output *)
{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}
```

The above code defines a basis and then computes its dual basis using the `Inverse` function. The result is then output as a matrix.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

What is a dual basis?
Can you explain how the code works?
