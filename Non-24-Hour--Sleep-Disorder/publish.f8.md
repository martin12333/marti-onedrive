How to Download the Symptom Tracker on my Android phone:
Download the Google Drive App and then open the app.

Open your Symptom Tracker Google Form in your browser. It will be the 'editable version' where you can't input data.

Select the 3 dots in the top right corner and select 'Preview' - it will open a new tab with the form where you can input data.

Select the 3 dots in the top right corner again and select 'Add to Home Screen.'
