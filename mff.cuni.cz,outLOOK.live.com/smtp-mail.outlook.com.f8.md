ter doing this and it had the OAuth2 authentication method in it where it wasn't available when I set it up as a hotmail account. TB/Mozilla needs to fix it's TB account setup defaults for hotmail to be like outlook.com

You may receive a connection error if you configured your Outlook.com account as IMAP in multiple email clients. Weâ€™re working on a fix and will update this article when we have more information. For now, try the following workaround:

Go to account.live.com/activity and sign in using the email address and password of the affected account.

Under Recent activity find the Session Type event that matches the most recent time you received the connection error and click to expand it.

Select This was me to let the system know you authorize the IMAP connection.

Attempt to connect to the account via your IMAP client.

For more information on how to use the Recent activity page, go to What is the recent activity page?
