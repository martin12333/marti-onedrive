You may receive a connection error if you configured your Outlook.com account as IMAP in multiple email clients. Weâ€™re working on a fix and will update this article when we have more information. For now, try the following workaround:

Go to account.live.com/activity and sign in using the email address and password of the affected account.

Under Recent activity find the Session Type event that matches the most recent time you received the connection error and click to expand it.

Select This was me to let the system know you authorize the IMAP connection.

Attempt to connect to the account via your IMAP client.

For more information on how to use the Recent activity page, go to What is the recent activity page?
