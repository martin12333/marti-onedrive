Manage how you sign in to Microsoft
An account alias is an email address or phone number that you use to sign in to your Microsoft account. You can have multiple aliases, and use any of them with Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, Skype, OneDrive, Office, Xbox, Windows and more.
Your account's primary alias is displayed on your Microsoft devices (such as a Windows PC, Xbox, or Windows Phone), and you can choose a different alias to be the primary one at any time. Learn more about account aliases.

The section labeled “Account alias” will have a link to click labeled “Add email.”

You have the option to create a new Outlook email address or add an existing email address as your Microsoft account alias. Whichever you choose will be your new primary email address.

## Copilot
Certainly! To create an email alias in Outlook.com, follow these steps:
- Sign in to your Microsoft account.
- Click on "Your Info".
- Go to "Manage your sign-in email address".
- Select "Add email alias".
- Enter the new email address you want as your alias (e.g., .....) and click "Add alias".
Here are some important notes:
- You cannot add an email address associated with a work or school account as an alias.
- An alias or email address can only contain letters, numbers, dot (.), underscore (_), or dash/hyphen (-). Spaces and other special characters are not allowed.
- Existing Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, and MSN addresses cannot be added as aliases, and you cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account.
- If you need a completely fresh start, sign out of Outlook.com and create a new account to get a new email address and inbox  .
Feel free to create your desired alias, and you'll receive emails sent to that address! 

Remember these points:

You can add up to 10 aliases per account.
