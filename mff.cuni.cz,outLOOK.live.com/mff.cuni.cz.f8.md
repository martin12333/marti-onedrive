## You
i have a default outlook email address e.g. outlook_4......@outlook.com ... i would like to get the messages, that are sent to the address e.g. martin.....@outlook.com ...  is  the correct way: to make an *alias*?
## Copilot
Certainly! To create an email alias in Outlook.com, follow these steps:
- Sign in to your Microsoft account.
- Click on "Your Info".
- Go to "Manage your sign-in email address".
- Select "Add email alias".
- Enter the new email address you want as your alias (e.g., .....) and click "Add alias".
Here are some important notes:
- You cannot add an email address associated with a work or school account as an alias.
- An alias or email address can only contain letters, numbers, dot (.), underscore (_), or dash/hyphen (-). Spaces and other special characters are not allowed.
- Existing Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, and MSN addresses cannot be added as aliases, and you cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account.
- If you need a completely fresh start, sign out of Outlook.com and create a new account to get a new email address and inbox  .
Feel free to create your desired alias, and you'll receive emails sent to that address! 

Remember these points:

You can add up to 10 aliases per account.
