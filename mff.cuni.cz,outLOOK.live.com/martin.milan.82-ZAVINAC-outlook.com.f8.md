An account alias is an email address or phone number that you use to sign in to your Microsoft account. You can have multiple aliases, and use any of them with Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, Skype, OneDrive, Office, Xbox, Windows and more.
Your account's primary alias is displayed on your Microsoft devices (such as a Windows PC, Xbox, or Windows Phone), and you can choose a different alias to be the primary one at any time. Learn more about account aliases.

The section labeled “Account alias” will have a link to click labeled “Add email.”



You have the option to create a new Outlook email address or add an existing email address as your Microsoft account alias. Whichever you choose will be your new primary email address.
