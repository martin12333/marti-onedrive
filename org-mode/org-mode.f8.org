- "[[http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2019.html][How to record executable notes with eev - and how to play them
  back]]": my talk at the EmacsConf 2019. Executable notes are mostly
  made of [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#3][sexp hyperlinks]] and [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#6][eepitch blocks]]. This talk has a quick
  explanation of sexp hyperlinks at [[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=5][slides 5 and 6]], a mention in [[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=8][slide
  8]] of my 20+ years of executable notes in [[http://angg.twu.net/e/]], and
  a very nice demo of playing back non-trivial executable notes in the
  video starting at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86yiRG8YJD0#t=13m10s][13:10]]; the demo of eepitch starts at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86yiRG8YJD0#t=15m11s][15:11]],

- "[[http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2020.html][On why most of the best features in eev look like 5-minute hacks]]":
  my talk at the EmacsConf 2020. It is mostly about design decisions;
  for example, starting at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAqBc42Gg8#t=30m40s][30:40]] it explains why eev implements a
  variant of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Help.html][M-x describe-key]] that it much more hacker-friendly than
  the standard one. At [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAqBc42Gg8#t=21m02s][21:02]] it shows how I use M-j to teach Emacs and
  eev to total beginners, and at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAqBc42Gg8#t=18m47s][18:47]] it explains the design
  decisions behind M-j.

- "[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxBjiUo88_U][How to install eev with M-x list-packages and how to navigate its
  tutorials]]". This is a video tutorial accessible to total beginners -
  with an approach that is the exact opposite of "[[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=10][users should not be
  forced to see Lisp]]".
