You can pre-expand the escapes like so

(
	printf -v R '\e[0;31m';
printf -v Z '\e[0m';
 echo "This is a ${R}red$Z word."
 )


. Then you can use them in a plain echo without -e (and even without the double quotes). â€“


read -n 6 x
#printf '\e[5n' ; read -n 4 x
#printf '\e[5n' ; read -n 1 x
#printf '\e[5n' ; read -n 5 x
#printf '\e[5n' ; read -n 6 x
#printf '\e[5n' ; read -n 0 x
#####printf '\e[5n  \n' ; read  x
printf '\e[5n' ; read  x

echo $x|od -c
echo $x






Author of term.js/tty.js[1] here. Nice work. You guys should keep an eye on term.js. The version you're using is slightly old and actually contains a bug (now fixed) wherein all events will become unbound if the reset control sequence is received. I'm also adding fixes for a few other things currently, such as double-width character support, which has been a problem in the past.
