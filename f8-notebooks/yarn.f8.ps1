yarn deletes all files and directories under node_modules that don't belong to the currently installed packages. This is part of the design. It does work differently than npm's pruning/cleaning of extraneous files.

For comparison, npm will only delete extraneous directories in node_modules if they have a package.json file. It won't remove other non-package directories. It also just never cleans anything out of node_modules/.bin. Even npm prune doesn't remove them.
