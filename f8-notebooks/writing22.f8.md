 am planning to try to run jtree test.ohayo from shell ...
EDIT: OK, Ohayo depends on jtree v49

@breck7 @SRS...  ?

I am going to try to run Ohayo from shell ...
EDIT: OK, Ohayo depends on jtree **v49**

is there a keyboard shortcut: to update the right-hand side of Ohayo (while editing on the left)?
(I know, I can click to the right-hand side with the mouse to update)



Thanks for asking.

I tried to specify the criteria:

* similarity of the data model
* similarity of the internal representation
* similarity of the syntax
* similarity of usage
* availability of converters
* what each format was derived from / aimed to replace
* maybe others

But I have used some fuzzy mix.

Now I am starting to realize, that some of my clusterings are somewhat dubious, even after editing the forest again.











I am trying to do a hierarchical clustering (by hand) ... of various tree (nested) data file formats ... in the form of a Tree-Notation file:


     JSON
      JSONC
       JSON5
        JSON6
         HJSON
          YAML-flow
           YAML-block
            NOON
      TOML
       ArchieML

     XML
      HTML
       Markdown

     (edited again)
     S-expressions
      EDN
      i-expressions
       Wisp (whitespace Lisp)
        Tree Notation
        OGDL
       Cirru
      EDN
       Rebol data
       Tcl data

     (how to name this group ... general string tree?)
      Jevko
