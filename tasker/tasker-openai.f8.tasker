Conversation history trouble
SOLVED

This code works well. Feel free to use it. It's rather simple and anyone with even a bit more Tasker know-how than I have could have done this.

Hello! Long time Tasker user, first time poster.

As I'm sure many of you also have, I have created a Task that calls the GPT-3 API and responds. It works. And very well. Hears my voice. Sends it to GPT-3 with a custom prompt. Responds with Say. Saves a log, unappended. Done.


I would like to add the ability to have conversation history. I would like some advice on how to do this. My current solution isn't working properly, and I'm not sure why. I have a suspicion is has something to do with either how Tasker reads files and saves them as variables or how it handles variables all together.

I have tried removing strange characters with Set Variable and RegEx. But that doesn't work. Reading history.txt and setting its contents to %hist doesn't work. Even using a completely blank history.txt doesn't work.

I believe there is something in the way the variable is handled that is causing this not to work.

I am receving a JSON error at the HTTP Request action.

This is the error:

0.50.25/E add wait type EasyAction1 time 2147483647
0.50.25/E add wait type EasyAction1 done
0.50.25/E add wait task
0.50.25/E Error: 1
0.50.25/E {
   "error": {
       "message": "We could not parse the JSON body of your request. (HINT: This likely means you aren't using your HTTP library correctly. The OpenAI API expects a JSON payload, but what was sent was not valid JSON. If you have trouble figuring out how to fix this, please send an email to support@openai.com and include any relevant code you'd like help with.)",
       "type": "invalid_request_error",
       "param": null,
       "code": null
   }
Right now, the order of operations is:

%GV_HEARD prompt.txt > %prompt HTTP REQUEST: %prompt/n%GV_HEARD AutoTools JSON READ: %http_data, %text Say: %text

And this works. But the second line should be: HTTP REQUEST: %prompt/%history/n%GV_HEARD

I am using Write File>history.txt with %gv_heard | Bot: %text|

Before calling the API, I am trying:

Read File > history.txt to var %hist

Then in the HTTP Request: %prompt/%hist/n%GV_HEARD

Thanks for reading. Please remember, this is confirmed to work. If I simply remove the %hist portion from the HTTP Request, it works fine. It also does not work even if %hist is completely blank.

Below is the exported Tasker code:

Please ignore the If statement. It is not accurate, lol. But it's still there.

I solved the issue.

The issue was when writing the history.txt file. Add Newline cannot be checked. That buggered it up. Not sure why, exactly. But it's solved, now.

Okay. I have confirmed that Tasker can read a file, turn it into a variable, and read it in the prompt.

So there is clearly something wrong with the format of how it's saving the "previous conversation". I will continue working on this.
