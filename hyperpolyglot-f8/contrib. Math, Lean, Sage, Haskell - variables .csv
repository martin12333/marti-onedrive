,,,,"Q1: Is there a direct way of expressing the relation ""y is a function of x "" inside set theory? ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The relation ""y is a function of x "" between two things y and x , was the original (and apparently only) way of using the word function in mathematics until roughly 1925.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,The things y and x were traditionally called variable quantities,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Although the word function assumed a different meaning with the rise of set theory an formal logic,",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,," the original relation is still used a lot among physicist, engineers or even mathematicians",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"given a fixed ""state space"" A , an R -valued quantity varying over A is a map Aâ†’R . ",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"However, you seem to be looking for something somewhat different, such as a formalism",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"hich the notion of ""variable quantity"" is basic rather than defined in terms of other things ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Here I think topos theory as well as type theory does indeed help,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"In calculus and its application to physics and other sciences, it is rather common to consider a variable, say y, whose possible values depend on the value of another variable, say x. In mathematical terms, the dependent variable y represents the value of a function of x.",,,,,,,,,,,
