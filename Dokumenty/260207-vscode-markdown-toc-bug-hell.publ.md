When the "Update TOC on save" feature is active, the extension wipes out the existing list and replaces it with a newly generated TOC based on the document's headers, leading to significant data loss if the user doesn't notice the change immediately to undo it.

Disable Auto-Update: Set "markdown.extension.toc.updateOnSave": false in your VS Code settings to prevent the extension from editing the file without your explicit command.

Ctrl + Shift + P -> Open Keyboard Shortcuts -> find markdown.extension.onEnterKey or markdown.extension.onBackspaceKey -> Right Click -> Remove Keybinding.
