for completion
what file should i type my first words into, before saving it as .f8.md?
vscode pin the file

pin file in vscode
mk  file  POWERSHELL-COMPLETION.f8.ps1
```powershell
D:\000doc24\
```

i remember that i have made a file near 
D:\000doc24\
with the name experiments*.f8.*

# vscode completion settings
```
onedrive/**vscode**completion
```

where does vscode completion get its data from?
maybe i should set it to the *opened* files?
