# problems and doubts during setting-up of github copilot

## why does github copilot need access to my private repositories?

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/813

https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/106551

**in the future may not  work without accepting??**


## maybe i clicked on check mark  ['/]  [`/]  [./] [v]  orgs  ... before accepting ? or it was taken as an acceptamce?

 it works


## old //////github copilot sign-out in ide ... how?


diag?

https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations

///Select the Accounts menu in the Activity Bar, and then select Sign out for the account you're currently signed in with for Copilot. Sign in to GitHub in VS Code: Select the Accounts menu in the Activity Bar, and then select Sign in with GitHub to use GitHub Copilot.

https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/configuring-github-copilot-in-your-environment?tool=vscode#revoking-github-copilot-authorization

> Visual Studio Code retains authorization to use GitHub Copilot through a particular GitHub account. If you want to prevent your GitHub account being used for GitHub Copilot on a device you no longer have access to, you can revoke authorization and then go through the authorization process again. The device you previously used will not have the new authorization.

After revoking authorization, Visual Studio Code will be able to continue using GitHub Copilot in a current session for a maximum of 30 minutes. After that time, you will need to reauthorize GitHub Copilot for use in Visual Studio Code again.

# EDIT: FIXED ...  keyboard # problem with accepting suggestions by  github copilot in markdown files

what is the key to  accepting suggestions by  github copilot in markdown files
tab

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions

but for me, the tab merely inserts the tab character, and the suggestions are not accepted

## EDIT: SEE BELOW disabled the docsmsft.docs-markdown extension
now tab works as expected
another possibility: i did not update the extension


## EDIT:  https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7146

### EDIT: https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/issues/1011#issue-996151712
We can add the !inlineSuggestionVisible 
			{
				"command": "markdown.extension.onTabKey",
				"key": "tab",
				"when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly && editorLangId =~ /^markdown$|^rmd$|^quarto$/ && !suggestWidgetVisible && !inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorHasMultipleSelections && !editorTabMovesFocus && !inSnippetMode && !hasSnippetCompletions && !hasOtherSuggestions && markdown.extension.editor.cursor.inList && !markdown.extension.editor.cursor.inFencedCodeBlock && !markdown.extension.editor.cursor.inMathEnv"

## "Tab"

### couldnt this be important???
settings.json
	// Insert spaces when pressing `Tab`. This setting is overridden based on the file contents when `editor.detectIndentation` is on.
	"editor.insertSpaces": false,   // true,


    "editor.detectIndentation": false,   // true,

### keybindings
{
  "key": "tab",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineEdit.accept",
  "when": "cursorAtInlineEdit && inlineEditVisible && !editorReadonly"
}
{
  "key": "tab",
  "command": "acceptSelectedSuggestion",

{
  "key": "tab",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.commit",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionHasIndentationLessThanTabSize && inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorHoverFocused && !editorTabMovesFocus && !suggestWidgetVisible"

## relatively free keys

alt+x
ctrl+\
altgr?
ctrl+alt+m

## quickfix?


{
  "key": "ctrl+right",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextWord",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly"
}


{
  "key": "",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine"
}

i will try to use alt+x for accepting suggestions by  github copilot in markdown files
it works but it is a bit pain
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly"
{
  "key": "alt+x",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly"
}

{
  "key": "ctrl+'",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly"
}

test it
now just need to remember it, and it will be fine

another possibility alt+a ? pain?
or alt+'
try alt+x whether altgr is the same as alt/ yes, or as alt+ctrl/ no
{
  "key": "alt+'",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly"
}
test it
now just need to remember it, and it will be fine


## quickfix?



{
  "key": "ctrl+enter",
  "command": "github.copilot.generate",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && github.copilot.activated && !commentEditorFocused && !inInteractiveInput && !interactiveEditorFocused"
}

closed the file ???


## quickfix?? ... does nothing

"Control+/"
{
  "key": "ctrl+/",
  "command": "editor.action.commentLine",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
}
github.copilot.activated 
!github.copilot.activated 

{
  "key": "ctrl+/",
  "command": "editor.action.commentLine",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly && !github.copilot.activated"
}



{
  "key": "ctrl+/",
  "command": "editor.action.accessibleViewAcceptInlineCompletion",
  "when": "accessibleViewIsShown && accessibleViewCurrentProviderId == 'inlineCompletions'"
}
{
  "key": "ctrl+/",
  "command": "github.copilot.acceptCursorPanelSolution",
  "when": "github.copilot.activated && github.copilot.panelVisible && activeWebviewPanelId == 'GitHub Copilot Suggestions'"
}


## old
could it be because of the settings in the settings.json file?
probably not, because it behaves the same way regardless of the settings in the settings.json file

# I'm noticing the following pattern while working with Jupyter notebooks: when things get slow, Copilot status icon is spinning.

I have a high-end PC and it still becomes crippling slow. It can be mitigated by reloading VS Code so there must be some underlying bug.

y VSCode was close to unusable with Copilot still a couple weeks ago. I did some searching and tweaking and now it is significantly better. Two things that I believe made all the difference:

I stopped working with a folder open, i.e., with a workspace, only opening individual files (and keeping as few of them open as possible).
I keep disabling Copilot with a key shortcut when I don't need it, because the worst lags coincide with the little Copilot icon in the bottom right corner spinning as Copilot is fetching an inline suggestion. The key shortcut required a little hack using the Toggle extension, because the shortcut "enable/disable Copilot completions" does not seem to work. If people could go upvote my bug report about this would be good to get it some visib

Working in Jupyter notebooks is becoming impossible. Most of the time, there are full seconds of delay between typing and characters appearing on the screen, particularly in markdown cells. The keyboard shortcut for disabling copilot completions isn't working as expected. I have tried the insiders release of vs code and the pre-release of copilot to no avail. This problem has only recently gotten insanely bad. Pylance and copilot also seem to be fighting each other.

I was having the same issue. For large projects, it seems copilot is too ambitious with the analysis. You can try reducing the scope of the search by changing the file settings (settings.json (USER)):
