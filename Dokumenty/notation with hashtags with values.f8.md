i have seen at github a quantified-self notation with hashtags with values like
```
some text #param(value)
```
but now i cannot find it


btw, i remember something like flicker(?) photo #machine-hashtags `#a:b=value `


Other cool features that would be nice: structure extraction (i.e., msg myself `#food #lunch cheeseburger` and `#mood tired` and then building a CSV of only what I ate vs how I felt), reminders (to encourage you to journal every so often, or to quickly have the bot remind you to check on something 12 hours from now), automatically posting external stuff like uptime alerts, calendar entries or commit logs, and other stuff I can't think of right now.. :)
