Magnesium can bind with certain medications, preventing their full absorption. 
If you are taking a tetracycline-type medication (such as demeclocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline),

 separate the time of the dose from the time of the magnesium supplement dose by at least 2 to 3 hours. 
 
 If you are taking a bisphosphonate (for example, alendronate), a thyroid medication (for example, levothyroxine), or a quinolone-type antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), ask your doctor or pharmacist about how long you should wait between doses and for help finding a dosing schedule that will work with all your medications.
