Calcium phosphate stones account for approximately 15% of kidney stone disease. Calcium phosphate stones tend to grow in alkaline urine, especially when Proteus bacteria are present. It is the most common type in pregnant women.[6]
Brushite is the original precipitating material in calcium phosphate kidney stones.[7] It is also one of the minerals present in dental calculi.

Dehydration from low fluid intake is a factor in stone formation.[14][18] Individuals living in warm climates are at higher risk due to increased fluid loss.[19] Obesity, immobility, and sedentary lifestyles are other leading risk factors.[19]



High dietary intake of animal protein,[14] sodium, sugars including honey, refined sugars, fructose and high fructose corn syrup,[20] and excessive consumption of fruit juices may increase the risk of kidney stone formation due to increased uric acid excretion and elevated urinary oxalate levels (whereas tea, coffee, wine and beer may decrease the risk).[19][18]

Table salt is made up of just under 40% sodium by weight, so a 6 g serving (1 teaspoon) contains about 2,400 mg of sodium.[62] Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance).[63] Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt.[6] The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia.[64] The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed.[65] In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.[66]

Magnesium can bind with certain medications, preventing their full absorption. 
If you are taking a tetracycline-type medication (such as demeclocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline),

 separate the time of the dose from the time of the magnesium supplement dose by at least 2 to 3 hours. 
 
 If you are taking a bisphosphonate (for example, alendronate), a thyroid medication (for example, levothyroxine), or a quinolone-type antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), ask your doctor or pharmacist about how long you should wait between doses and for help finding a dosing schedule that will work with all your medications.
