# markdown for AI # how many spaces for indents in markdown itself (not a code block) 
markdown for AI .. how many spaces for indents in markdown itself (not a code block)

**2 spaces** is the practical answer for AI-readable markdown, but the full picture:

| Context | Spaces | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| CommonMark spec (nested lists) | matches content offset | `- ` = 2sp, `1. ` = 3sp |
| Original Gruber Markdown | **4** | tab or 4 spaces |
| Most parsers in practice | **2** | widely accepted |

| AI consumption | **2** | consistent, compact, unambiguous |

---

**CommonMark's actual rule** — indent to where the content starts:

```markdown
- item
  - nested      ← 2 spaces (after "- ")
    - deeper    ← 4 spaces

1. item
   - nested     ← 3 spaces (after "1. ")
```

---



**For AI-targeted markdown specifically**, 2 spaces wins because:



- Tokens are precious — 4 spaces wastes them at scale
- LLMs trained on GitHub/web content have seen 2-space indent far more often than 4
- Deeply nested structures stay readable without drifting right

---

**The one hard rule:** be **consistent within a document**. Mixed 2/4 indentation is what actually breaks parsers and confuses models — the exact number matters less than uniformity.







# digital-garden repos ..  aboutme.md???   about-me.md   file ? does anybody already use such filename?
yes




//////
Prior art that's close but not quite this:

README.md in personal repos (too repo-centric)
humans.txt (web standard, too terse)
IndieWeb h-card (structured but not prose)
/now pages (temporal snapshot, not durable context)





# AGENTS.md
# https://jules.google/#plans
# analogous to CLAUDE.md
??
GEMINI.md
AGENTS.md
CUSTOM.md
???

> Here's the full picture of AI coding assistant instruction files:

| Tool | File |
|------|------|
| Claude (Claude Code) | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Gemini (Gemini CLI) | `GEMINI.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

but https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions



| Cursor | `.cursor/rules` or `.cursorrules` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |
| Aider | `CONVENTIONS.md` (or via `--read`) |
| Cline | `.clinerules` |
| Zed AI | `.rules` |

what is missed here?

| Tool / ecosystem                              | File / location                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI Codex / many agents**                | `AGENTS.md`                                                                                          |
| **Sourcegraph Amp**                           | `AGENTS.md` now; older docs/examples used `AGENT.md`                                                 |
| **JetBrains Junie**                           | `AGENTS.md`, often imported into `.junie/AGENTS.md`; older references mention `.junie/guidelines.md` |
| **Roo Code**                                  | `.roo/rules/`, `.roo/rules-{mode}/`, plus workspace rule files/directories                           |
| **Continue.dev**                              | `.continue/rules/*.md`                                                                               |
| **Amazon Q Developer**                        | `.amazonq/rules/*.md`                                                                                |
| **Firebase Studio / Project IDX Gemini chat** | `.idx/airules.md`                                                                                    |
| **Replit Agent**                              | `replit.md`                                                                                          |
| **Qodo**                                      | Rules are mainly managed in the Qodo platform, not a simple repo markdown file                       |
| **Generic / cross-tool emerging convention**  | `AGENTS.md`                                                                                          |



These files all serve the same purpose: **persistent, repo-scoped instructions** that tell the AI about your project's conventions, architecture, preferred patterns, and constraints — so you don't have to repeat yourself each session.

A few nuances worth knowing:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** is auto-loaded by Claude Code from the repo root, home directory, or any parent directory — and can be nested per-subdirectory.
- **Copilot's** file lives in `.github/` and applies across the whole repo for any editor with the Copilot extension.
- **Cursor** recently shifted from `.cursorrules` (flat file) to `.cursor/rules/` (a directory of scoped `.mdc` files with per-pattern applicability).
- **`CUSTOM.md`** isn't a standard convention for any major tool yet — though some teams use it as a project-internal scratchpad and reference it explicitly in prompts.

The emerging informal standard across the ecosystem is **a Markdown file at repo root**, which makes sense since it's human-readable documentation too.




How do I configure Gemini CLI?
Configure Gemini CLI to use AGENTS.md in .gemini/settings.json:

{ "context": { "fileName": "AGENTS.md" }, }
