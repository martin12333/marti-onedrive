maybe i  deleted backups of MILAN 1dr
while thinking they were of mar 1 dr  ?

MAYBE BECAUSE I **CLONED** THE SETTINGS  ?!

// probably not: MAYBE BECAUSE ONEDRIVE IS NOT A NORMAL FOLDER ... there are ... STRANGE ~~~JUNCTI WHEN VIEWED FROM LINUX .... AND I SHOULD BE LOGGED-IN AS MILAN TO BACKUP MILAN ?!
// probably not


quickfix: set  different  output directories
still strange in gui cleanup dele
