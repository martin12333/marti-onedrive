maybe deleted backups of MILAN 1dr
while thinking they were of mar 1 dr  ?

MAYBE BECAUSE I **CLONED** THE SETTINGS  ?!

MAYBE BECAUSE ONEDRIVE IS NOT A NORMAL FOLDER
... STRANGE ~~~JUNCTI WHEN VIEWED FROM LINUX ....
AND I SHOULD BE LOGGED-IN AS MILAN TO BACKUP MILAN ?!


quickfix: set  different  output directories
still strange in gui cleanup dele
