Debugging Life Issues:


Documentation:
Good code comes with comments and documentation. Apply this to your life by keeping track of important information. Document your experiences, learnings, and insights. Whether it‚Äôs a travel diary, a recipe book, or a personal wiki, having organized documentation helps you recall and learn from the past.


Refactoring:
Refactoring code involves improving its structure without changing its behavior. In life, periodically review your routines and habits. Are there areas where you can simplify, declutter, or improve? Refactor your daily processes to enhance productivity and well-being.
