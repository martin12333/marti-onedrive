I would like to ask: would you enable github discussions in your repo?



when is eepitch-kill really needed  ?

I am still not sure, when it is really needed to run the line

```
 (eepitch-kill)

```

... Maybe when i want to demo something publicly, and i want to clear the mess, that was in the terminal before the demo starts ?

(i am a beginner in Emacs)

I have made some e-scripts, and i notice i  copied only the line

```
 (eepitch-eshell)
```






(I have started a wiki, where 1 page about eepitch)

https://github.com/martin12333/Run-selected-text--discussions/wiki/eev-eepitch

(i have added there some comments from the mailing list)

Manifesto

I would like to comment on some parts of the eev manifesto:

> I have placed essentially all my "scripts" written in this way (I call them "e-scripts") in a public place.

I use a text file form (format), that is similar to e-scripts for eepitch. I call the format: f8_text_file . My collection of these files is at

https://github.com/martin12333/marti-onedrive

> They contain almost everything I know about Unix.

My files are mostly for a shell (\*.f8.sh), some are for PowerShell (\*.f8.ps1), some are \*.f8.py, ...


, *.f8.py, etc., ... not only *.f8.ps1 for PowerShell)




f8_text_file--clouddrive--monorepo ... a public collection of text files, that contain a mix of one-line commands and notes (*.f8.sh, *.f8.py, etc., ... not only *.f8.ps1 for PowerShell)



f8_text_file(s) (not only for PowerShell), browserPOSIX, visual_conlangs

In my collection, 


i will write more later

((btw, the filenames ... "Eda" is my nephew, he is 10))
