I would like to ask: would you enable github discussions in your repo?



when is eepitch-kill really needed  ?

I am still not sure, when it is really needed to run the line

```
 (eepitch-kill)

```

... Maybe when i want to demo something publicly, and i want to clear the mess, that was in the terminal before the demo starts ?

(i am a beginner in Emacs)

I have made some e-scripts, and i notice i  copied only the line

```
 (eepitch-eshell)
```






(I have started a wiki, where 1 page about eepitch)
