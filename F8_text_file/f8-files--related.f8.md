PowerShell Notebooks are documents which can contain both #PowerShell code and markdown. They are interactive and “executable documents”.

. ... but I live by F8) and needing python to run PowerShell seems odd ...

> I always liked how Powershell ISE has this feature where I can select the command and press F8 to run it in the command window.



it's supported by default shortcut "shift" + "enter".


... F8 in VSCode is ..., I use this all the time for testing scripts.









Run Selection/Line in Terminal (REPL)

The Python: Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal command (Shift+Enter) is a simple way to take whatever code is selected, or the code on the current line if there is no selection, and run it in the Python Terminal. An identical Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal command is also available on the context menu for a selection in the editor.
VS Code automatically removes indents based on the first non-empty line of the selection, shifting all other lines left when needed.








To me ... THE main feature of VSCode,...



gih issue focus

For years I have enjoyed using this feature multiple times a day (workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText) and I always have a keyboard shortcut configured to run it for all sorts of commands (cmd, wsl, az cli, ...)

org-babel-screen is an extension to Org-babel and was inspired by Eduardo Ochs's eev.

>  Eduardo calls a sexp a button and pressing M-e executes that sexp. Before eev, I used to do something similar, having sexp in comments and pressing C-e (go to end of line) and then C-x C-e (evaluate last sexp), but Eduardo named it properly, gave it a key (M-e) and built whole way of thinking around that.


> eepitch blocks are much more useable than for example org-mode code blocks, where it is difficult to figure out, how to specify/configure the code block. With eepitch, it is simply all commands, and if you for example tunnel ssh or run stuff in various languages non-homogenously, it is just lines of texts run on a key press F8.

I still use GNU eev. To be honest, I have abandoned it more or less and
like my first love, I always come back to it ;)

I use daily eepitch for all sort of stuff. I even created my own eepitch-X extensions (I am a DBA and need to use sqlplus and things like that). I would be very happy to contribute it back but I did not find any SCM to prepare my patch.

> Just a quick message to say how thankful I am to all of you. I have successfully done my *real* first e-script in the *real* life. The job was way way easier to do with eepitch-shell than if I had to type all again by hand. I successfully migrated an Oracle Dataguard from one machine to another with very few keystrokes !!

   I am very interested! I have some very good e-scripts scattered at
   <http://angg.twu.net/e/>, but they are buried among megabytes of
   mess... May I help? :-)
