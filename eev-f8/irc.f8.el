If youâ€™re chatting from a laptop, then you might be familiar with this problem: When your laptop falls asleep and wakes up later, your IRC client doesnâ€™t realize that it has been disconnected. It takes several minutes until the client decides that the connection has in fact been lost. The simple solution is to use M-x rcirc. The problem is that this opens an additional connection, so youâ€™ll have two copies of every channel buffer, one dead and one live.

One option therefore, is the

/reconnect

command.

An other approach is to set rcirc-reconnect-delay to a value greater than 0, and allow rcirc to reconnect when it detects that the connection has been closed. By default it will try to do this three times (as specified by rcirc-reconnect-attempts), before giving up.


Gives you some basic information about a nick. This often includes what other channels people are on. (Also /whois fsbot.)

21:57 /whois edrx



ress someone specifically, for example as an answer to a question, it is customary to prefix the message with the nick followed by a colon, like this:

deego: fsbot rules!
Since this is so common, you can use TAB to do nick completion.







 Before I go reinventing the wheel, does anybody know
              of a /rectangle/ version of
              buffer-substring-no-properties??

 I figured out that it is ivy that is
                   failing tramp


				    I wish I was better at debugging why tramp hangs
              trying to ssh to machines; it seems I learn and then
              immediately unlearn how to diagnose and fix this with
              each year that passes.



			   have you set tramp-verbose to 7 and retried?
			    now look in the *tramp debug* buffer
 (and it's not helpful, but I'll continue to
                recommend using an sshfs mount rather than tramp



 it is stupefying in that sensd
