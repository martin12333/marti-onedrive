execute each one with M-e in sequence

(code-c-d "marti" "C:/Users/marti/OneDrive/" :anchor)
(find-martifile ".emacs.d/xah.el")
(find-fline   "~/.emacs.d/xah.el")

dir c:\Users\marti\.em*







Today i have attached a piece of paper to the wall near my monitor, with big
M-j
M-k
M-e
M-T

----

Now i realized, that
~/.emacs.d/xah.el
is also correct, because
~/.emacs.d is a symlink

can you now navigate to another file inside C:/Users/marti/OneDrive/
and then type M-x klf?
this should "kill link to file
